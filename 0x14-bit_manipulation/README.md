# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

## General
- Look for the right source of information without too much help
- How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

### 0. unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

### 1. void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

### 2. int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

### 3. int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

### 4. int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

### 5. unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

**Advanced tasks:**

### 6. int get_endianness(void);
Write a function that checks the endianness.

### 7. Find the password for a program.
Your file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
